FlowTag V.2.0  Written By: Christopher Lee and scholar01
=============
FlowTag is a GUI interface for exploring the TCP flows in a PCAP (network trace 
recorded by libpcap, tcpdump, ethereal, or wireshark) file.  It's strengths lie 
in:
  * rapid reconstruction of flows (via indexing), 
  * visual selection of source IP and destination TCP ports; 
  * filtering by time, packet count, and/or byte count
  * tagging flows with keywords

Version 2.0 is a Ruby port of the original PERL version of FlowTag presented by 
Christopher Lee at VisSEC '06 [1].  The PERL code was never released because, 
"Everything is global and in one file, half of the model is contained in the 
widgets, and I had no clue what it would become when I started.  This ... needs 
to be rewritten...".

In the Ruby version, there are several companion tools for generating the flow 
database, dumping the flows, and dumping the contents of a flow.  If you want 
to perform analysis of large numbers of flows with powerful statistical tools, 
please take a look at SiLK Tools [4].  Our tool was designed to be much simpler.

To run this code, you will need a version of Ruby with Tk installed.  I tried 
hard not to use any fancy Tk widgets that would create other dependencies.  If 
you install ruby via MacPorts, you will need to compile it with the +tk or 
+mactk variant [2].

There is a really nice Parallel Coordinates [3] widget included in this 
package.  It is mostly a port from Chris' code, but I added support for more 
than 2 axes and arbitary formatting.  Both Chris and I hope that other people 
can take this widget and do some very nice work with it.  We apologize for its 
current shortcomings.

Future Work
===========
  * The FlowDB API is guarenteed to change by V2.1, but will try to stay stable 
thereafter.
  * Implement multiple selections via the ParallelCoordinates widget.
  * A new file format that combines the .pkts, .flows, .tags, and the pcap 
files (can you say, .tar? or perhaps fuse + cramfs)
  * Comments, documentation, examples, testing, and all that other stuff that 
is always promised but never delivered (don't hold your breath for this one)
  * Opening up development to the general public under a reasonable license
  * Export flows to files (chopping off HTTP headers when needed)
  * Payload searches (this is heavy-weight, ngrep might be a better option)
